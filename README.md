# <p style="float:right">Translating JVM bytecode to ARM instructions</p>
This was initially a course project for Digital System Design, then became my BA thesis. It is a hardware (and software) implementation of a co-processor which can translate JVM bytecode (only a subset, including the arithmetic) to ARM machince instructions. It is tested on a raspberry PI 3 and can generate much faster executables (up to 15x) than running on top of the JVM engine.
